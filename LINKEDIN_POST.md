🎯 Excited to share my latest Flutter project: **The Blacklist** - A Criminal Profile Management App!

Inspired by the hit TV series, I built a cross-platform mobile application that demonstrates modern app development practices with real-world functionality.

🚀 **Key Features:**
✅ Real-time search & filtering
✅ Photo upload with Firebase Storage
✅ Cloud database with Firestore
✅ Material Design 3 dark theme
✅ Full CRUD operations
✅ Threat level tracking system
✅ Location & alias management

💻 **Tech Stack:**
• Flutter for cross-platform development
• Firebase (Firestore & Storage) for backend
• Material Design 3 for modern UI
• Image Picker for media handling

This project showcases my skills in:
📱 Mobile app development
☁️ Cloud integration
🎨 UI/UX design
🔄 Real-time data synchronization

The app features an intuitive interface with search functionality, photo management, and detailed criminal profiles - all synchronized in real-time across devices.

**Suggested Image Ideas:**
1. App screenshot showing the main list view
2. Detail page with a profile
3. Search functionality in action
4. Side-by-side comparison of add/edit dialogs

**Tips:**
- Add 3-4 screenshots as carousel images
- Tag relevant companies (Google, Firebase, Flutter)
- Post during peak hours (Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM)
- Engage with comments within first hour
